## World Happiness


### Project Description

As a global society, we are waking up to the fact that happiness in our daily lives is extremely important. The positive effects of a balanced mind spread not only throughout a person's life, but also throughout society in a stone-in-the-pond figure of speech. 

Corporations, governments, and organisations are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of happiness. It could be noted that when minimum satisfaction standards are reached people are better able to contribute to their day to day lives and respective duties, and that it is also in their best interests to contribute to people's well-being. As a result, satisfaction metrics are constantly being used in policy decisions all around the globe.

The purpose of this project is to dive in and analyse the happiness score per country around the world and the main characteristics of what forms “Happiness”.
